# 👤 personal-profile-

This repo holds the **very first webpage I ever created**.  
It’s as basic as it gets — no polish, no fancy styling — but it was my **first step into web development**,  
and it still means a lot to me. 🌱

---

## 📖 About
- A super simple **personal profile page**.  
- Built with **basic HTML (and a sprinkle of CSS, if any)**.  
- Represents the exact moment I went from *curious* to *creating*.  

---

## 🚀 What I Learned
- The **absolute basics** of HTML structure.  
- How to write my first `<h1>`, `<p>`, and maybe even `<img>` tags.  
- That even the simplest page can feel exciting when it’s *yours*.

## 💡 Reflections
Looking back, this project may seem small — but to me, it was huge.  
It marks the **starting point of my journey as a developer**,  
and every project since then grew from this tiny beginning.  

> “Every big journey starts with a single `<html>` tag.” 💻

## 🔮 Next Steps
I could easily rebuild this now with cleaner design and better CSS —  
but this version will always stay here as my **first footprint in code**.
